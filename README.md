# .dotfiles

These are my **personal dotfiles**, crafted over time through experimentation, research, and adaptation. They are used to configure my development environment on **macOS**, with a strong focus on CLI productivity and consistency.

### 🌙 Theme

I aim for a consistent visual experience using the [Dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com) across my terminal, editors, and other CLI tools.

### 📌 Notes

- Many configurations are inspired by community dotfiles and blog posts. I didn’t always track original sources — apologies for missing attributions.
- If you recognize something distinctive from your work and want credit, please open an issue or PR and I’ll be happy to include it.
- If you spot anything that looks like **sensitive or private data** (e.g. tokens, hostnames, etc.), please notify me immediately.

### 🤝 Contributing / Chat

Feel free to:

- Take inspiration or copy what’s useful to you.
- Suggest improvements, alternative tools, or better approaches.
- Share ideas via issues or discussions — I’m always refining this setup.
